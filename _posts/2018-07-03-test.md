There is no content here. Let's test with a bunch of text. 

This is where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations. It's better than kicking the puppy dog around and all that so. See there how easy that is. You don't have to be crazy to do this but it does help.

Just take out whatever you don't want. It'll change your entire perspective. Let's go up in here, and start having some fun This is your world. These little son of a guns hide in your brush and you just have to push them out.

This is truly an almighty mountain. We don't really know where this goes - and I'm not sure we really care. A happy cloud. Now let's put some happy little clouds in here.

What the devil. Don't fiddle with it all day. We wash our brush with odorless thinner. That's a son of a gun of a cloud.

Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend. Maybe he has a little friend that lives right over here. It's a very cold picture, I may have to go get my coat. Itâ€™s about to freeze me to death. We spend so much of our life looking - but never seeing.

And that's when it becomes fun - you don't have to spend your time thinking about what's happening - you just let it happen. It is a lot of fun. If you overwork it you become a cloud killer. There's nothing worse than a cloud killer. You're meant to have fun in life. The only prerequisite is that it makes you happy. If it makes you happy then it's good. Every single thing in the world has its own personality - and it is up to you to make friends with the little rascals.

The least little bit can do so much. That is when you can experience true joy, when you have no fear. Poor old tree. How do you make a round circle with a square knife? That's your challenge for the day. Just relax and let it flow. That easy. Let your heart be your guide.

Brown is such a nice color. Let's go up in here, and start having some fun Let's put some happy little bushes on the other side now. A little happy sunlight shining through there. Let the paint work. You don't want to kill all your dark areas they are very important.

Use your imagination, let it go. But we're not there yet, so we don't need to worry about it. Let your heart be your guide. It's amazing what you can do with a little love in your heart.

There comes a nice little fluffer. It's important to me that you're happy. I was blessed with a very steady hand; and it comes in very handy when you're doing these little delicate things. Here we're limited by the time we have. Use what happens naturally, don't fight it.

Let's do that again. Nature is so fantastic, enjoy it. Let it make you happy. I will take some magic white, and a little bit of Vandyke brown and a little touch of yellow. Everybody needs a friend.

Get away from those little Christmas tree things we used to make in school. Volunteering your time; it pays you and your whole community fantastic dividends. In painting, you have unlimited power. You have the ability to move mountains. You can bend rivers. But when I get home, the only thing I have power over is the garbage. It just happens - whether or not you worried about it or tried to plan it.

We wash our brush with odorless thinner. With practice comes confidence. A happy cloud.

See there how easy that is. Anyone can paint. Now we don't want him to get lonely, so we'll give him a little friend. I can't think of anything more rewarding than being able to express yourself to others through painting. Use what you see, don't plan it.
